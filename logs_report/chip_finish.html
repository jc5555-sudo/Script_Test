       CTS-973  (info)  The value of option cts.compile.enable_cell_relocation
       has been overridden to &quot;leaf_only&quot; to support latency-driven placement.

DESCRIPTION
       If option place.coarse.latency_driven_placement is true, placement will
       attempt to move clock gating cells to improve clock latency. To prevent
       clock gate relocation from altering the locations of these cells, clock
       gate  relocation  will be done in leaf_only mode. Only leaf-level clock
       gates will be moved by clock gate  relocation.  This  overrides  option
       cts.compile.enable_cell_relocation.

       Latency-driven  placement  happens  at  the place_opt flow stage. Clock
       gate relocation happens at the clock_opt flow stage.

WHAT NEXT
       To use clock gate relocation mode other than &quot;leaf_only&quot;, it is  neces-
       sary     to    disable    latency-driven    placement.    Set    option
       place.coarse.latency_driven placement to  false  during  place_opt  and
       clock_opt  flow  stages.  Clock latency may degrade as a consequence of
       this.

       This message is printed when the specified level shifter is not associ-

       When  the  tool cannot associate level shifter cells with level shifter
       strategies, it might be caused by one of these reasons:  level  shifter
       cell is not inserted based on any strategy, it might purely be inserted
       to fix the voltage shifting automatically;  or  the  level  shifter  is
       inserted base on certain strategy, but the nestlist got changed without
       introducing any extra violation. In  any  case,  existing  power/ground
       supply  nets  of  the  cell are maintained. No association will pose no
       problem in downstream tools.

       ZRT-825  (Warning)  Pin or route connects to PG user_route (%.3f, %.3f,

DESCRIPTION
       This  warning  is issued for possible incorrect usage of PG user_route.
       In router, pins or routes connect to PG user_routes are treated as con-
       nected  to  pre-routes. Router will not take them as opens or floatings
       which need further tie off connections.
