DESCRIPTION
       This message occurs when the voltage difference of  driver  supply  net
       and load supply net is larger than the voltage threshold. This can hap-
       pen when the driver supply net and the load supply net  have  different

WHAT NEXT
       o Check the voltage values of the two supply nets.

       o Also, consider to change the voltage threshold if the voltage differ-
       ence is within acceptable tolerance.

       This  warning  message  indicates  that  the  sequential element is not

DESCRIPTION
       The specified object is neither a valid timing startpoint nor endpoint.
       Commands  such  as  set_false_path, set_multicycle_path, and group_path

       One important limitation to note is that the call to update_timing com-

       One  major  example  is  clock gating checks if the pin connects to the
