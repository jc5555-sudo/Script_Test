       LNK-031 (information) Skipping module '%s', using frozen block '%s'.

DESCRIPTION
       This  message  tells  you  that  a stub module in the Verilog source is
       being skipped and the 'frozen' version of the block is being used  from
       the  reference  library list.  A block is considered frozen if it has a
       FRAME view.  This action only occurs during the initial link  of  newly
       read Verilog.

       If  the  app  option  link.prefer_frame  is  set to true, then 'frozen'
       blocks (that is, blocks with a FRAME view) are preferred  over  Verilog
       modules.   If  the app option is set to false, then Verilog modules are
       preferred over 'frozen' blocks.

       When a 'frozen' block is used, the linker uses the view switch list  to
       decide  which  view of that block to link to.  This can be changed with
       the set_view_switch_list command.  Individual instances can be  changed
       to  reference a different view with the change_abstract, change_view or
       set_reference commands.

       The number of skipped module messages displayed for each block is  con-
       trolled  by  the  app option link.reference_limit.  Additional messages
       are suppressed.  When a block has skipped modules, a  message  is  dis-
       played giving the number of modules skipped for each block.

WHAT NEXT

DESCRIPTION
       The extractor extract the coupling  caps  per  physical  block  in  the
       design.   If SI analysis is turned on, coupling caps on the nets cross-
       ing the physical hierarchy are stitched on the parasitic network.   The
       coupling  caps are also edited during post route optimization flow cor-
       responding to on-route optimization changes.

"UIC-009","Warning","NAME
       UIC-009  (warning)  Object  '%s' is not a valid %s. The %s command will
       not match this object.

DESCRIPTION
       The specified object is neither a valid timing startpoint nor endpoint.
       Commands  such  as  set_false_path, set_multicycle_path, and group_path
       require the -from option from_list objects to be  valid  timing  start-
       points and the -to option to_list objects to be valid timing endpoints.

       One important limitation to note is that the call to update_timing com-
       mand may cause the creation of path endpoints  at  combinational  pins.
       One  major  example  is  clock gating checks if the pin connects to the
       signal gating the clock signal. In that  case,  entering  an  exception
       before an update_timing would emit this message, whereas doing so after
       an update_timing would not.

WHAT NEXT
       Use input ports or register clock pins for the from_list objects.   Use
       output ports or register data pins for the to_list objects.

DESCRIPTION
       This   message    occurs    when    the    attribute    specified    in
       set_design_attributes or set_port_attributes command is not used by the
       tool.

       These attributes are read during load_upf, and stored in the  database,
       and  saved  in  the  output  UPF  created by save_upf. But they have no
       impact on the tool's optimization or power intent behavior.

       Typically, these attributes are either user defined,  or  are  used  by
       other  tools.  Just  because ICC II does not support this attribute, it
       does not mean that ICC II lacks support for the feature enabled by this
       attribute in another tool. The implementation of that feature in ICC II
       may be different and not rely on an attribute setting, or may rely on a
       different attribute or app option setting.

       VER-936  (warning)  %s  the  undeclared symbol '%s' assumed to have the

DESCRIPTION
       The Verilog standard says that if no explicit declaration is given  for
       an   identifier   and   the  identifier  is  not  in  the  scope  of  a
       '`default_nettype none' compiler directive, then it shall be assumed to
       be  implicitly  declared  as  a  net  of the default net type, which is
       'wire' unless overridden with the `default_nettype compiler  directive.
       Specifically, this is assumed for undeclared identifiers used in a port
       expression declaration, for undeclared identifiers used in the terminal
       list  of  a  primitive  instance  or a module instance, and, in Verilog
       2001, for undeclared identifiers that appear on the left-hand side of a
