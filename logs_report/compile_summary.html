DESCRIPTION
       This warning message is issued when instance is  mapped  to  a  libcell
       where  there  is  no  nextstate_type attribute defined on its ports. In
       this case, functional input pairs like D/SET, D/CLEAR  can  be  swapped
       during net connection as they are logically equivalent. Tool can&#x27;t tell
       which port is the &quot;true&quot; data port.

WHAT NEXT
       User can ignore this warning if they don&#x27;t care about  pin  connection.
       Otherwise  choose  another  libcell  which  is  properly  defined  with

WHAT NEXT
       Examine the reported nets to ensure that the dont_touch attributes have
       been  applied  with  good  reason.   In particular, dont_touch on high-
       fanout or other large nets can cause latency  problems  after  CTS,  as
       that  large  net  will  not  be buffered.  dont_touch attributes can be
       removed   with   the   set_dont_touch,    set_dont_touch_network,    or
       mark_clock_tree  commands.  set_dont_touch is normally used for setting
       and  clearing  dont_touch  on  individual  nets  or   cell   instances.
       set_dont_touch_network  is used to apply dont_touch to an entire fanout
       from a clock or pin.  Note that set_dont_touch_network will  not  trace
       from  a master clock through to a generated clock.  mark_clock_tree can
       be used also to apply or clear dont_touch.  Unlike  set_dont_touch_net-
       work, mark_clock_tree will trace through generated clocks.

       CTS-903  (Warning)  Cells  instantiated in the clock network are not in
       the clock reference list

DESCRIPTION
       CTS can only size to lib_cells that are specified in the  clock  refer-
       ence   list,   constrained  using  &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose  -include  cts
       $lib_cell_list&#x27;.  This message indicates that some  cells  instantiated
       in the clock network have reference lib_cells that are not in the clock
       reference list.  If there are logically  equivalent  lib_cells  in  the
       reference list, then these instances can still be resized to those log-
       ically equivalent lib_cells, if necessary.  There is no guarantee  that
       the  cell  will be resized, and once resized it cannot be sized back to
       the original lib_cell that was not in the reference list.

       If there are no logically equivalent cells in the reference list,  then
       this  cell  will not be resized by CTS, and a CTS-904 message will also
       be issued by check_clock_trees, indicating that no logically equivalent
       cells are available.

WHAT NEXT
       No  action  is  necessary  if the behavior described above is okay.  If
       resizing of the cell  is  desired,  ensure  that  logically  equivalent
       lib_cells  are  available  using the &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts
       $lib_cell_list&#x27; command.  Note that there is no guarantee that the cell
       will  be  resized,  and  so it may remain in the clock network with its
       original reference cell which was not supplied in the  clock  reference
       list.  If you want to guarantee that this reference cell does not exist
       in the clock network after CTS completes, then you must manually  asso-
       ciate it to a new lib_cell using the change_link command before running
       CTS.

       CTS-904 (Warning) Some clock reference cells have no LEQ cell specified

DESCRIPTION
       CTS cannot resize a cell in the clock network unless  there  are  logi-
       cally equivalent lib_cells specified in the clock reference list.  This
       message indicates that there are cells instantiated in the  clock  net-
       work that have no logically equivalent lib_cells in the reference list,
       so no sizing can be done.

WHAT NEXT
       If the cell does not need to be sized, or has optimization  constraints
       like dont_touch that prevent sizing, then no action is necessary.  Oth-
       erwise, use &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts  $lib_cell_list&#x27;,  where
       $lib_cell_list  includes  logically  equivalent  lib_cells  to the ones
       reported by this check.  This will ensure that the cell can be  resized
       during CTS.

DESCRIPTION
       This  message  reports a failed attempt to create wire or via using the
       compile_pg command. The reason for failure can be either wrong  parame-
       ters in the compile_pg command or DRC violations. Perform the following
       steps to ascertain the actual cause of failure.  1) Check  for  invalid
       parameter  in the compile_pg command using &lt;-ignore_drc&gt; option. If the
       compile_pg  command  fails  to  create  wires  and/or  vias  with   the
       &lt;-ignore_drc&gt;  option,  it  means  that some invalid parameter has been
       provided to the compile_pg command. Use the  details  provided  in  the
       compile_pg  command  page  to know more about valid parameters that you
       can use with this command. Try running the command again  with  correct
       parameters. If the command succeeds in creating wires and vias, proceed
       to  the  next  step.   2)  Run  the  compile_pg  command  without   the
       &lt;-ignore_drc&gt; option but add the &lt;-show_phantom&gt; option. If the command
       fails to create some wires and  vias  then  some  DRC  violations  have
       occurred.  To  view  the details of the DRC violations, use View-&gt;Error
       Browser in the tool GUI.

WHAT NEXT
       On finding any DRC rule violation you can look at the relevant DRC man-
       uals  to  rectify any related issues in the design. The DRC manuals can

<tr class='WARNING'><td>ZRT-511</td><td>Warning</td><td><pre>NAME
       ZRT-511 (Warning) Cell contains tie connections which are not connected
       to real PG.

DESCRIPTION
       Cell contains some tie nets (tie_low or tie_high) which  are  not  con-
       nected to real PG. These nets will not contain route information unless
       they are realized with PG rail. To connect to PG rail,  users  need  to
       call &quot;connect_pg_net&quot; command.

       An example for query such a net is
        get_nets -hierarchical -filter net_type=~tie_low

WHAT NEXT
       Run &quot;connect_pg_net&quot;.</pre></td><td>[fill severity]</td><td>Warning: Cell contains tie connections which are not connected to real PG. (ZRT-511) (MSG-3032)</td><td>[fill solution]</td></tr>

       ZRT-625  (warn)  Master  cell  %s  has duplicated redundant library pin
       shapes at {%.3f %.3f} {%.3f %.3f} on layer %s.

DESCRIPTION
        Duplicated redundant library pin shapes are found at  the  give  loca-
       tion.
        The coordinates are relative to the library inside.
        These  incorrect  data will impact the router performance and DRC con-
       vergence.

WHAT NEXT
        Please remove the redundant pin shapes.
        Please also review the tool flow, they might be generated from  incor-
       rect
        library preparation flow.</pre></td><td>[fill severity]</td><td>Warning: Master cell bit_coin has duplicated redundant library pin shapes at {-1.368 0.001} {-1.064 2499.319} on layer M3. (ZRT-625) (MSG-3032)</td><td>[fill solution]</td></tr>

       router and run check_legality before running check_routability.</pre></td><td>[fill severity]</td><td>Warning: Cell compile_ZBUF_4_inst_194305 is placed overlapping with other cells at {{3082.856 2029.648} {3086.504 2031.320}}. (ZRT-763) (MSG-3032)</td><td>[fill solution]</td></tr>
