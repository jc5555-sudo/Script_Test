DESCRIPTION
       The  attribute  you are trying to get is not found on the object, or is
       out-of-date.  If the attribute is  out-of-date,  a  timing  update  may
       establish  its  value.   There is a way to suppress this message if you
       desire.  For example, if this is in a loop or in a procedure (-quiet?)

       This message is printed when the specified power  switch  cell  is  not

       will not be able to check and ensure that the power  switch  cells  are
       properly  inserted  and  consistent  with  the  power switch strategies
       intended for the cells.

       in  terms of  either  arc-based  or   pin-based   CCS  noise  model(s).
