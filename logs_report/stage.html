<tr><td>ATTR-11</td><td>Info</td><td><pre>NAME
       ATTR-11 (information) The returned value for %s &#x27;%s&#x27; is the design spe-
       cific attribute override defined within the current block &#x27;%s&#x27;.

DESCRIPTION
       This command returned the design specific attribute value from the cur-
       rent  block,  instead  of the actual value from the library. Within the
       block, the design specific attribute value overrides the library value.
       It was set previously by the set_attribute command,
         because library settings may not be overwritten. This override may
         be removed by the remove_attributes command.</pre></td><td></td><td>Information: The returned value for lib_cell &#x27;saed32rvt_tt_v125c:NBUFFX8_RVT.timing&#x27; is the design specific attribute override defined within the current block &#x27;bit_coin&#x27;.

       CHF-014 (Warning) option -continue_on_error turned on automatically.

DESCRIPTION
       You  receive  this  warning  message  because you did not specify -con-
       tinue_on_error and  -rules  {  no_1x},  and  doesn&#x27;t  provide  size  1x
       fillers.  Tool therefore turn on -continue_on_error automatically so it
       will skip unfillable 1x gaps and continue to fill the  rest.  This  may
       lead to unfillable gaps.

       is     larger    than    what    is    specified    in    app    option

       check or build connectivity to tie to other PG pre-routes.

DESCRIPTION
       This  warning  is issued for possible incorrect usage of PG user_route.
       In router, pins or routes connect to PG user_routes are treated as con-
       nected  to  pre-routes. Router will not take them as opens or floatings
       which need further tie off connections.

       Set the user_route to other shape_use if necessary.</pre></td><td></td><td>Pin or route connects to PG user_route (%.3f, %.3f, %.3f, %.3f) on layer (%s) is considered as tied. Would not further check or build connectivity to tie to other PG pre-routes.\n (MSG-3032)</td><td></td></tr>
