       This message is indicating that the legalization has detected that  the

       LNK-031 (information) Skipping module &#x27;%s&#x27;, using frozen block &#x27;%s&#x27;.

DESCRIPTION
       This  message  tells  you  that  a stub module in the Verilog source is
       being skipped and the &#x27;frozen&#x27; version of the block is being used  from
       the  reference  library list.  A block is considered frozen if it has a
       FRAME view.  This action only occurs during the initial link  of  newly
       read Verilog.

       If  the  app  option  link.prefer_frame  is  set to true, then &#x27;frozen&#x27;
       blocks (that is, blocks with a FRAME view) are preferred  over  Verilog
       modules.   If  the app option is set to false, then Verilog modules are
       preferred over &#x27;frozen&#x27; blocks.

       When a &#x27;frozen&#x27; block is used, the linker uses the view switch list  to
       decide  which  view of that block to link to.  This can be changed with
       the set_view_switch_list command.  Individual instances can be  changed
       to  reference a different view with the change_abstract, change_view or
       set_reference commands.

       The number of skipped module messages displayed for each block is  con-
       trolled  by  the  app option link.reference_limit.  Additional messages
       are suppressed.  When a block has skipped modules, a  message  is  dis-
       played giving the number of modules skipped for each block.

WHAT NEXT
       No action is required.  This is just information only.

       To  see  more  skipped  module messages, set the app option link.refer-
       ence_limit to a larger number,  re-read  the  verilog  and  relink  the
       block.

         prompt&gt; read_verilog ...

       To  see  the  names  of  all  the modules being suppressed, set the app
       option link.reference_limit to -1, re-read the verilog and  relink  the
       block.

         prompt&gt; read_verilog ...

       To  not  prefer  a  specific  block over the Verilog module, remove the
       library containing that block from the reference library list.

         prompt&gt; set_ref_libs -remove frozen_blocks.nlib

       To remove the &#x27;frozen&#x27; state from a specific block,  remove  the  FRAME
       view of that block.

         prompt&gt; remove_blocks -force myLib:myBlock.frame

       To  always  prefer  Verilog  modules  over  &#x27;frozen&#x27;  blocks,  set  the

DESCRIPTION
       This message occurs when the voltage difference of  driver  supply  net
       and load supply net is larger than the voltage threshold. This can hap-

       incomplete.

WHAT NEXT
       o Check the voltage values of the two supply nets.

       o Also, consider to change the voltage threshold if the voltage differ-
       ence is within acceptable tolerance.

       o  Check analyze_mv_design -level_shifter to report issues that prevent
       Level Shifter insertion.

       o Check analyze_mv_feasibility to know why Enabled Level Shifter  cells
       cannot be use for insertion.

       o Please check Level Shifter supply availability in Power Domains where
       cell is expected to be inserted.

       o Check if there is a dont_touch present on the net requiring  a  Level
       Shifter.

       o  To  debug Enabled Level Shifter issues, check report_mv_path for any
       Isolation or Level Shifter strategy that may apply on the path.

DESCRIPTION
       This message occurs when the supply net of the specified driver pin  or
       PG  net  is  less always-on than the related supply net of the load pin
       and an Isolation Cell is missing. An Isolation Cell is required to iso-
       late  the  signal  path  if  the driver of the net is less always-on or
       unrelated to the load pin.

WHAT NEXT
       o Check the power states of the supply nets with report_pst.

       o  Use report_mv_path to report any Isolation strategy that  may  apply
       on the path.

       o   Check  analyze_mv_feasibility  for Isolation Cell and Enabled Level
       Shifter cell mapping related issues.

       o Check report_mv_lib_cells for availability of  a  suitable  Isolation
       Cells.

       o  Run report_mv_path -net -isolation to check if there is any strategy
       applied but not implemented.  If there is no strategy  applied,  please
       add necessary Isolation strategy.

       The error message occurs when there are unconstrained endpoints in  the

       for the unconstrained endpoints: false path, no check, unclocked,  dis-

       The reported input port is not a clock source. The port does  not  have
       an  input delay value, and it also has paths from it which are not dis-

       from  the  port,  a  realistic input delay needs to be provided for all
       data input ports.

       The violation message will give you the input port which has  no  input
       delay  specified.   To  resolve  this  issue, consider specifying input

       UIC-009  (warning)  Object  &#x27;%s&#x27; is not a valid %s. The %s command will

DESCRIPTION
       The specified object is neither a valid timing startpoint nor endpoint.
       Commands  such  as  set_false_path, set_multicycle_path, and group_path
       require the -from option from_list objects to be  valid  timing  start-
       points and the -to option to_list objects to be valid timing endpoints.

       One important limitation to note is that the call to update_timing com-
       mand may cause the creation of path endpoints  at  combinational  pins.
       One  major  example  is  clock gating checks if the pin connects to the
       signal gating the clock signal. In that  case,  entering  an  exception
       before an update_timing would emit this message, whereas doing so after
       an update_timing would not.

WHAT NEXT
       Use input ports or register clock pins for the from_list objects.   Use
       output ports or register data pins for the to_list objects.

       These attributes are read during load_upf, and stored in the  database,
       and  saved  in  the  output  UPF  created by save_upf. But they have no
       impact on the tool&#x27;s optimization or power intent behavior.

       Typically, these attributes are either user defined,  or  are  used  by
       other  tools.  Just  because ICC II does not support this attribute, it
       does not mean that ICC II lacks support for the feature enabled by this
