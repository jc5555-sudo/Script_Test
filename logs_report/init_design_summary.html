DESCRIPTION
       This message is indicating that the legalization has detected that  the

       If a site master does not have either of &quot;X-Symmetry&quot; and &quot;Y-Symmetry&quot;,
       the standard cells will have limited  legal  orientations  because  the
       standard cells will not be allowed to flip within the site rows.

DESCRIPTION
       This message occurs when the voltage difference of  driver  supply  net
       and load supply net is larger than the voltage threshold. This can hap-
       pen when the driver supply net and the load supply net  have  different
       voltage  values in power state table or the port states definitions are
       incomplete.

WHAT NEXT
       o Check the voltage values of the two supply nets.

       o Also, consider to change the voltage threshold if the voltage differ-
       ence is within acceptable tolerance.

       o  Check analyze_mv_design -level_shifter to report issues that prevent
       Level Shifter insertion.

       o Check analyze_mv_feasibility to know why Enabled Level Shifter  cells
       cannot be use for insertion.

       o Please check Level Shifter supply availability in Power Domains where
       cell is expected to be inserted.

       o Check if there is a dont_touch present on the net requiring  a  Level
       Shifter.

       o  To  debug Enabled Level Shifter issues, check report_mv_path for any
       Isolation or Level Shifter strategy that may apply on the path.

DESCRIPTION
       This message occurs when the supply net of the specified driver pin  or
       PG  net  is  less always-on than the related supply net of the load pin
       and an Isolation Cell is missing. An Isolation Cell is required to iso-
       late  the  signal  path  if  the driver of the net is less always-on or
       unrelated to the load pin.

WHAT NEXT
       o Check the power states of the supply nets with report_pst.

       o  Use report_mv_path to report any Isolation strategy that  may  apply
       on the path.

       o   Check  analyze_mv_feasibility  for Isolation Cell and Enabled Level

       o Check report_mv_lib_cells for availability of  a  suitable  Isolation

       out is already connected to a net. In this case, the tool might discon-
       nect the original net and reconnect the port or the pin to the new net.

DESCRIPTION
       This  warning  message  indicates  that  the  sequential element is not
       mapped to retention library cells despite being  part  of  a  retention
       strategy.  This results in verification/simulation failure.

       Sequential element can be a mapped/unmapped register, ETM or hard-macro
       with sequential timing arcs.

WHAT NEXT
       Check the retention strategy commands for the correctness  and/or  make
       sure  the  library  has required retention cells and run the command to
       map the netlist.  If the reported sequential element is an ETM or hard-

       can ignore this message for such elements.

       delay  specified.   To  resolve  this  issue, consider specifying input

DESCRIPTION
       The specified object is neither a valid timing startpoint nor endpoint.
       Commands  such  as  set_false_path, set_multicycle_path, and group_path
       require the -from option from_list objects to be  valid  timing  start-
       points and the -to option to_list objects to be valid timing endpoints.

       One important limitation to note is that the call to update_timing com-
       mand may cause the creation of path endpoints  at  combinational  pins.
       One  major  example  is  clock gating checks if the pin connects to the
       signal gating the clock signal. In that  case,  entering  an  exception
       before an update_timing would emit this message, whereas doing so after
       an update_timing would not.

WHAT NEXT

<tr><td>VER-936</td><td>Warning</td><td>NAME
       VER-936  (warning)  %s  the  undeclared symbol &#x27;%s&#x27; assumed to have the
       default net type, which is &#x27;%s&#x27;.

DESCRIPTION
       The Verilog standard says that if no explicit declaration is given  for
       an   identifier   and   the  identifier  is  not  in  the  scope  of  a
       &#x27;`default_nettype none&#x27; compiler directive, then it shall be assumed to
       be  implicitly  declared  as  a  net  of the default net type, which is
       &#x27;wire&#x27; unless overridden with the `default_nettype compiler  directive.
       Specifically, this is assumed for undeclared identifiers used in a port
       expression declaration, for undeclared identifiers used in the terminal
       list  of  a  primitive  instance  or a module instance, and, in Verilog
       2001, for undeclared identifiers that appear on the left-hand side of a
       continuous assignment statement.

WHAT NEXT
       Check  your  design to make sure that you intended an implicit declara-
       tion for this symbol.  If not, add an explicit declaration.
