       This message is printed when the specified power  switch  cell  is  not

       The  tool cannot associate power switch cells with power switch strate-

       properly  inserted  and  consistent  with  the  power switch strategies
       intended for the cells.

       This net has a very large number of pins so it will not  be  extracted.
       This  net was probably not meant to be detail routed.  There will be no

       Unreasonable  hold  violation here means the hold violation is so large
       that it costs more than 20 max-delay buffers to fix.   However,  fixing
       such  hold violations usually leads to density and QoR issues, so it is
       now skipped in the hold fixing engine by default.

DESCRIPTION
       Each edge of a shape should always be on the min manufacture  grid.  If
       this is not satisfied, DRC checking can&#x27;t be accurate. This rule should
       apply to all the features on the layout.

WHAT NEXT
       If the off minGrid shape is a fixed shape from the libary, try  to  fix
       them  manully. If the shape is a routable shape, it should be automati-
       clly fixed after running detailed route.</td><td>[fill severity]</td><td>Shape {%d %d %d %d} on layer %s is not on min manufacturing grid. Snap it to {%d %d %d %d}. The shape belongs to Net: %s. (MSG-3032)</td><td>[fill solution]</td></tr>

       ZRT-825  (Warning)  Pin or route connects to PG user_route (%.3f, %.3f,

DESCRIPTION
       This  warning  is issued for possible incorrect usage of PG user_route.
       In router, pins or routes connect to PG user_routes are treated as con-
       nected  to  pre-routes. Router will not take them as opens or floatings
       which need further tie off connections.
