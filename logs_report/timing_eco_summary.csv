       under  derived  hierarchical  modules  to resolved compatibility issues
       with other tools. The derived hierarchies are only added  during  ASCII
       output and are not represented in the block. The ASCII outputs that are
       affected are Verilog and SPEC from write_verilog  and  write_parasitics
       commands.  The  app  option does not impact the output of save_upf com-
       mand. That means logical mismatches can  exist  between  the  UPF  from
       save_upf command and SPEF or Verilog netlist.

       To  write a compatible UPF that includes the hierarchical wrappers, use
       the write_verilog  command.  When  the  app  option  is  set  to  true,
       write_verilog  will write a Verilog netlist and a compatible UPF at the
       same time.  The UPF will have the same name as the  Verilog  file  with
       the added extension "".SNPS.upf"".

WHAT NEXT
       If   you   have  a  multi-voltage  design  and  are  allowing  physical
       feedthrough buffers (opt.common.allow_physical_feedthroughset is  true)
       to  be  added during optimization and CTS, then you should use the com-
       patible UPF created by the write_verilog command for  ASCII  import  to
       other tools.

       If  you  are not allowing any physical feedthrough buffers during opti-
       mization and CTS, you can ignore this warning or  set  the  app  option
       mv.upf.write_crosstool_wrappers to false to avoid this message.
