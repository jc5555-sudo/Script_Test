       The  attribute  you are trying to get is not found on the object, or is

       CTS-973  (info)  The value of option cts.compile.enable_cell_relocation
       has been overridden to ""leaf_only"" to support latency-driven placement.

DESCRIPTION
       If option place.coarse.latency_driven_placement is true, placement will
       attempt to move clock gating cells to improve clock latency. To prevent
       clock gate relocation from altering the locations of these cells, clock
       gate  relocation  will be done in leaf_only mode. Only leaf-level clock
       gates will be moved by clock gate  relocation.  This  overrides  option
       cts.compile.enable_cell_relocation.

       Latency-driven  placement  happens  at  the place_opt flow stage. Clock
       gate relocation happens at the clock_opt flow stage.

WHAT NEXT
       To use clock gate relocation mode other than ""leaf_only"", it is  neces-
       sary     to    disable    latency-driven    placement.    Set    option
       place.coarse.latency_driven placement to  false  during  place_opt  and
       clock_opt  flow  stages.  Clock latency may degrade as a consequence of
       this.

       When  the  tool cannot associate level shifter cells with level shifter

       inserted base on certain strategy, but the nestlist got changed without
