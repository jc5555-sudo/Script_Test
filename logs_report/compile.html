DESCRIPTION
       This warning message is issued when instance is  mapped  to  a  libcell
       where  there  is  no  nextstate_type attribute defined on its ports. In
       this case, functional input pairs like D/SET, D/CLEAR  can  be  swapped
       during net connection as they are logically equivalent. Tool can&#x27;t tell
       which port is the &quot;true&quot; data port.

WHAT NEXT
       User can ignore this warning if they don&#x27;t care about  pin  connection.
       Otherwise  choose  another  libcell  which  is  properly  defined  with

       and  effective values of the process number, process label, voltage, or
       temperature  operating  conditions  of  a   particular   corner.    The
       report_pvt  command will print information and warnings identifying the
       mismatched values, the relevant cell libraries, the number of  affected
       cells, and the operating conditions that will actually be used for tim-
       ing analysis.

WHAT NEXT
       Review the P/V/T operating conditions supported by  the  relevant  cell
       libraries.   Review  whether  specified  P/V/T  is missing some library
       cells.  Review the constraints for missing  or  incorrect  set_voltage,
       set_temperature,  set_process_number, set_process_label, or set_operat-
       ing_conditions commands.  Review the  UPF  data  for  an  incorrect  or
       incomplete  supply net configuration.  The report_pvt command will give
       more information about this situation.</pre></td><td></td><td>Warning: Corner FUNC_0.85V_HOLD:  4 process number, 0 proces... (MSG-3032)</td><td></td></tr>

DESCRIPTION
       This  information  prints  the  detailed  reason why an object is being
       skipped by CCD.  Objects can be clock sinks or intermediate pins in the
       clock network.

       Following  are  the  possible  reasons  that  can  cause CCD to skip an
       object:

   Sink is boundary
       The sink is in the fanin/fanout of I/O ports. So this is considered  as
       a  boundary  flop.   ccd.optimize_boundary_timing  is  set as false and
       hence boundary flops cannot be skewed by CCD.

   Sink is a fixed balance pin
       The sink has  the  attribute  cts_fixed_balance_pin  set  to  true  and
       ccd.respect_cts_fixed_balance_pins application option is enabled.

   Pin is not in the balance portion of the clock tree
       Pin  is  in  the ignore portion of the clock tree and CCD will not skew
       this pin. Use report_clock_qor -type  structure  and  report_clock_bal-
       ance_points  to  confirm  that  the  ignore exception settings are user
       intended.

   Pin is on dont_touch net
       Clock  net  connected  to  the  pin  is  marked  as   dont_touch.   Use
       report_dont_touch  on  the clock net to check if the dont_touch setting
       is user intended.

   Pin is on read_only net
       Clock net connected to this pin is marked as read_only. This could be a
       sub-block not being editable.

   Pin is in abstract or ETM
       Pins in abstracts or ETMS lack proper timing/power models and cannot be
       power shaped.

WHAT NEXT
       See CCD-002 for the total number of skipped objects  for  each  reason.

       CTS-012  (Warning)  Nets  in  the  clock network have a dont_touch con-
       straint

DESCRIPTION
       Nets in the clock network have been marked with a dont_touch attribute.
       dont_touch  on  a net prevents sizing, optimization, and replacement of
       all attached cells.  It also prevents buffering on the net.  dont_touch
       can  limit  CTS  optimization,  which can cause worse latency, skew, or
       area in the clock network.

WHAT NEXT
       Examine the reported nets to ensure that the dont_touch attributes have
       been  applied  with  good  reason.   In particular, dont_touch on high-
       fanout or other large nets can cause latency  problems  after  CTS,  as
       that  large  net  will  not  be buffered.  dont_touch attributes can be
       removed   with   the   set_dont_touch,    set_dont_touch_network,    or
       mark_clock_tree  commands.  set_dont_touch is normally used for setting
       and  clearing  dont_touch  on  individual  nets  or   cell   instances.
       set_dont_touch_network  is used to apply dont_touch to an entire fanout
       from a clock or pin.  Note that set_dont_touch_network will  not  trace
       from  a master clock through to a generated clock.  mark_clock_tree can
       be used also to apply or clear dont_touch.  Unlike  set_dont_touch_net-
       work, mark_clock_tree will trace through generated clocks.

       CTS-903  (Warning)  Cells  instantiated in the clock network are not in
       the clock reference list

DESCRIPTION
       CTS can only size to lib_cells that are specified in the  clock  refer-
       ence   list,   constrained  using  &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose  -include  cts
       $lib_cell_list&#x27;.  This message indicates that some  cells  instantiated
       in the clock network have reference lib_cells that are not in the clock
       reference list.  If there are logically  equivalent  lib_cells  in  the
       reference list, then these instances can still be resized to those log-
       ically equivalent lib_cells, if necessary.  There is no guarantee  that
       the  cell  will be resized, and once resized it cannot be sized back to
       the original lib_cell that was not in the reference list.

       If there are no logically equivalent cells in the reference list,  then
       this  cell  will not be resized by CTS, and a CTS-904 message will also
       be issued by check_clock_trees, indicating that no logically equivalent
       cells are available.

WHAT NEXT
       No  action  is  necessary  if the behavior described above is okay.  If
       resizing of the cell  is  desired,  ensure  that  logically  equivalent
       lib_cells  are  available  using the &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts
       $lib_cell_list&#x27; command.  Note that there is no guarantee that the cell
       will  be  resized,  and  so it may remain in the clock network with its
       original reference cell which was not supplied in the  clock  reference
       list.  If you want to guarantee that this reference cell does not exist
       in the clock network after CTS completes, then you must manually  asso-
       ciate it to a new lib_cell using the change_link command before running
       CTS.

DESCRIPTION
       CTS cannot resize a cell in the clock network unless  there  are  logi-
       cally equivalent lib_cells specified in the clock reference list.  This
       message indicates that there are cells instantiated in the  clock  net-
       work that have no logically equivalent lib_cells in the reference list,
       so no sizing can be done.

WHAT NEXT
       If the cell does not need to be sized, or has optimization  constraints
       like dont_touch that prevent sizing, then no action is necessary.  Oth-
       erwise, use &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts  $lib_cell_list&#x27;,  where
       $lib_cell_list  includes  logically  equivalent  lib_cells  to the ones
       reported by this check.  This will ensure that the cell can be  resized

       This message is printed when the specified level shifter is not associ-
       ated with any level shifter strategies.

       When  the  tool cannot associate level shifter cells with level shifter
       strategies, it might be caused by one of these reasons:  level  shifter
       cell is not inserted based on any strategy, it might purely be inserted
       to fix the voltage shifting automatically;  or  the  level  shifter  is
       inserted base on certain strategy, but the nestlist got changed without
       introducing any extra violation. In  any  case,  existing  power/ground
       supply  nets  of  the  cell are maintained. No association will pose no
       problem in downstream tools.

       The  tool cannot associate power switch cells with power switch strate-
       gies if there are any discrepancies between them. In such a case,  sup-
       ply  net  connections of the power switch cells cannot be automatically
       derived by the tool. While it is sufficient to continue the implementa-
       tion  flow if supply net connections are explicitly specified, the tool
       will not be able to check and ensure that the power  switch  cells  are
       properly  inserted  and  consistent  with  the  power switch strategies
       intended for the cells.

DESCRIPTION
       This message shows the number of mv cells out of total same type  cells
       in  design  that have been associated with the strategy. Association is
       the process of pairing UPF  power  management  strategies  (i.e.  level
       shifting,  isolation,  repeater,  etc.)  with existing power management
       cells in the design.

WHAT NEXT
       This is an information-only message. No action is required if the  num-
       ber  of associated cells is expected. If some cells are not associated,
       it is an indication that some part  of  the  defined  strategy  is  not
       matching  with the instantiated power management cell.  For example, if
       the related supplies of a level shifter input and output pin are  elec-
       trically  equivalent, the level shifter will not get associated because
       voltage differential is needed. The related supplies of a  pin  can  be
       checked with the get_related_supply_nets command. In order for any cell
       to get automatically associated, all  of  the  defined  UPF  constrains
       associated  with that strategy need to match with the implementation of
       the power management cell.  Any discrepancy can lead to an unassociated
       cell.  The following is a partial list of checks performed during auto-
       matic association of power management cells:

       Level shifters
         -map cells against instance lib cell
         -physical location vs. strategy location
         -related supplies of load and driver
         -voltage differential against threshold and level shifter rules
         -included and excluded element list associated with strategy

       Isolation cells
         -map cells vs. instance lib cell
         -physical location vs. strategy location
         -related supplies of load and driver and enable pin vs. strategy
         -connection to the control signal
         -included and excluded element list associated with strategy

       Retention registers
         -map cells vs. instance lib cell
         -location vs. power domain
         -connection to the save and restore signals
         -associated supply sets
         -included and excluded element list associated with strategy

       Power switches
         -map cells vs. instance lib cell
         -location vs. power domain (i.e. voltage area)
         -connection to sleep and acknowledge pins
         -related supplies of input, output and control ports
         -associated supply sets
         -instances associated with strategy

       Repeater cells
         -location vs. power domain
         -related supplies of output vs. strategy
         -included and excluded element list associated with strategy

       Association  can  be  manually  performed  using  the  set_power_strat-
       egy_attribute command.  If automatic association fails and manual asso-
       ciation is used, check_mv_design report should be used to validate  the
       newly  associated cell is not failing multi-voltage checks.  If a power
       management cell is associated with a UPF strategy, the association will
       be registered under cell attribute power_strategy.

       Some useful commands for debugging association issues are:
         -get_related_supply_net for checking driver and load related supplies
         -all_fanin or all_fanout for tracing pin connectivity to control sig-
       nals
         -report_cell -power for seeing PG pin connectivity of a cell
         -report_mv_path -full  for  understanding  the  connectivity  of  the
       multi-voltage path

       OPT-055  (Information)  Current  block utilization is &#x27;%.5f&#x27;, effective
       utilization is &#x27;%.5f&#x27;.

DESCRIPTION
       This message provides the  current  block  utilization  numbers  during
       optimization.  In some designs, density PG structure at low metal layer
       may block some sites for placement.  Also, existence  of  multi-row  or
       inbound  cells can cause unusable sites adjacent to these cells.  There
       are also color-based cell spacing rules that can cause unusable  sites.
       The  effective utilization number is calculated by treating these unus-
       able sites as used area.  Therefore, this is a more accurate  represen-
       tation of the cell density seen by placement and optimization engines.

       The  estimation  for the number of unusable sites adjacent to multi-row
       or inbound cells is controlled  by  place.utilization.multi_row_penalty
       and place.utilization.inbound_penalty options.

       The  estimation  for the number of unusable sites under low metal layer
       PG    nets    is    controlled    by    place.coarse.pnet_aware_layers,
       place.coarse.pnet_aware_min_width  and  place.coarse.pnet_aware_density
       options.

       Keepout margins are not included in block  utilization  but  the  sites
       covered  by  keepout  margins are not available for optimization usage.
       Therefore, keepout margins will also increase the effective utilization
       number.

WHAT NEXT
       If effective utilization is much larger than utilization, check the low
       metal layer PG structure or use &quot;analyze_lib_cell_placement  -lib_cells
       [all_lib_cells]&quot;  to  see how many library cells became unusable due to
       PG structure.  Also, check to see if the utilization penalty for multi-
       row and inbound cells are setup properly.

       This  message  reports a failed attempt to create wire or via using the

       ters in the compile_pg command or DRC violations. Perform the following
       steps to ascertain the actual cause of failure.  1) Check  for  invalid
       parameter  in the compile_pg command using &lt;-ignore_drc&gt; option. If the
       compile_pg  command  fails  to  create  wires  and/or  vias  with   the
       &lt;-ignore_drc&gt;  option,  it  means  that some invalid parameter has been
       provided to the compile_pg command. Use the  details  provided  in  the
       compile_pg  command  page  to know more about valid parameters that you
       can use with this command. Try running the command again  with  correct
       parameters. If the command succeeds in creating wires and vias, proceed
       to  the  next  step.   2)  Run  the  compile_pg  command  without   the
       &lt;-ignore_drc&gt; option but add the &lt;-show_phantom&gt; option. If the command
       fails to create some wires and  vias  then  some  DRC  violations  have
       occurred.  To  view  the details of the DRC violations, use View-&gt;Error
       Browser in the tool GUI.
