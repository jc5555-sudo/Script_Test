       CTS-012  (Warning)  Nets  in  the  clock network have a dont_touch con-
       straint

DESCRIPTION
       Nets in the clock network have been marked with a dont_touch attribute.
       dont_touch  on  a net prevents sizing, optimization, and replacement of
       all attached cells.  It also prevents buffering on the net.  dont_touch
       can  limit  CTS  optimization,  which can cause worse latency, skew, or
       area in the clock network.

WHAT NEXT
       Examine the reported nets to ensure that the dont_touch attributes have
       been  applied  with  good  reason.   In particular, dont_touch on high-
       fanout or other large nets can cause latency  problems  after  CTS,  as
       that  large  net  will  not  be buffered.  dont_touch attributes can be
       removed   with   the   set_dont_touch,    set_dont_touch_network,    or
       mark_clock_tree  commands.  set_dont_touch is normally used for setting
       and  clearing  dont_touch  on  individual  nets  or   cell   instances.
       set_dont_touch_network  is used to apply dont_touch to an entire fanout
       from a clock or pin.  Note that set_dont_touch_network will  not  trace
       from  a master clock through to a generated clock.  mark_clock_tree can
       be used also to apply or clear dont_touch.  Unlike  set_dont_touch_net-
       work, mark_clock_tree will trace through generated clocks.

       CTS-903  (Warning)  Cells  instantiated in the clock network are not in

DESCRIPTION
       CTS can only size to lib_cells that are specified in the  clock  refer-
       ence   list,   constrained  using  'set_lib_cell_purpose  -include  cts
       $lib_cell_list'.  This message indicates that some  cells  instantiated
       in the clock network have reference lib_cells that are not in the clock
       reference list.  If there are logically  equivalent  lib_cells  in  the
       reference list, then these instances can still be resized to those log-
       ically equivalent lib_cells, if necessary.  There is no guarantee  that
       the  cell  will be resized, and once resized it cannot be sized back to
       the original lib_cell that was not in the reference list.

       If there are no logically equivalent cells in the reference list,  then
       this  cell  will not be resized by CTS, and a CTS-904 message will also
       be issued by check_clock_trees, indicating that no logically equivalent
       cells are available.

WHAT NEXT
       No  action  is  necessary  if the behavior described above is okay.  If
       resizing of the cell  is  desired,  ensure  that  logically  equivalent
       lib_cells  are  available  using the 'set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts
       $lib_cell_list' command.  Note that there is no guarantee that the cell
       will  be  resized,  and  so it may remain in the clock network with its
       original reference cell which was not supplied in the  clock  reference
       list.  If you want to guarantee that this reference cell does not exist
       in the clock network after CTS completes, then you must manually  asso-
       ciate it to a new lib_cell using the change_link command before running
       CTS.

DESCRIPTION
       CTS cannot resize a cell in the clock network unless  there  are  logi-

"OPT-055","Info","NAME
       OPT-055  (Information)  Current  block utilization is '%.5f', effective
       utilization is '%.5f'.

DESCRIPTION
       This message provides the  current  block  utilization  numbers  during
       optimization.  In some designs, density PG structure at low metal layer
       may block some sites for placement.  Also, existence  of  multi-row  or
       inbound  cells can cause unusable sites adjacent to these cells.  There
       are also color-based cell spacing rules that can cause unusable  sites.
       The  effective utilization number is calculated by treating these unus-
       able sites as used area.  Therefore, this is a more accurate  represen-
       tation of the cell density seen by placement and optimization engines.

       The  estimation  for the number of unusable sites adjacent to multi-row
       or inbound cells is controlled  by  place.utilization.multi_row_penalty
       and place.utilization.inbound_penalty options.

       The  estimation  for the number of unusable sites under low metal layer
       PG    nets    is    controlled    by    place.coarse.pnet_aware_layers,
       place.coarse.pnet_aware_min_width  and  place.coarse.pnet_aware_density
       options.

       Keepout margins are not included in block  utilization  but  the  sites
       covered  by  keepout  margins are not available for optimization usage.
       Therefore, keepout margins will also increase the effective utilization
       number.

WHAT NEXT
       If effective utilization is much larger than utilization, check the low
       metal layer PG structure or use ""analyze_lib_cell_placement  -lib_cells
       [all_lib_cells]""  to  see how many library cells became unusable due to
       PG structure.  Also, check to see if the utilization penalty for multi-
       row and inbound cells are setup properly.
