<tr><td>CTS-012</td><td>Warning</td><td>NAME
       CTS-012  (Warning)  Nets  in  the  clock network have a dont_touch con-
       straint

DESCRIPTION
       Nets in the clock network have been marked with a dont_touch attribute.
       dont_touch  on  a net prevents sizing, optimization, and replacement of
       all attached cells.  It also prevents buffering on the net.  dont_touch
       can  limit  CTS  optimization,  which can cause worse latency, skew, or
       area in the clock network.

WHAT NEXT
       Examine the reported nets to ensure that the dont_touch attributes have
       been  applied  with  good  reason.   In particular, dont_touch on high-
       fanout or other large nets can cause latency  problems  after  CTS,  as
       that  large  net  will  not  be buffered.  dont_touch attributes can be
       removed   with   the   set_dont_touch,    set_dont_touch_network,    or
       mark_clock_tree  commands.  set_dont_touch is normally used for setting
       and  clearing  dont_touch  on  individual  nets  or   cell   instances.
       set_dont_touch_network  is used to apply dont_touch to an entire fanout
       from a clock or pin.  Note that set_dont_touch_network will  not  trace
       from  a master clock through to a generated clock.  mark_clock_tree can
       be used also to apply or clear dont_touch.  Unlike  set_dont_touch_net-
       work, mark_clock_tree will trace through generated clocks.

DESCRIPTION
       Buffer tree has restrictions applied to it. Check the restriction  rea-
       son  of.CTS-076. The possible reasons could be dc_generic, pd_boundary,
       physical_block,  freeze_port,  non_inverted_pin,  exclusive_move_bound,
       target_library_subset  , mv_special and etc.  dc_generic:            dc
       generic.  pd_boundary:           this  pin  (conn  or  port)  is  power
       domain  boundary port.  physical_block:        this hier corresponds to
       a physical  block.   freeze_port:            this  is  a  freeze  port.
       non_inverted_pin:       this  is  to  prevent boundary phase inversion.
       exclusive_move_bound:  the pin is in an  exclusive  move  bound.   tar-
       get_library_subset:  The  hier pin has 2 sides. The hiers of both sides
       have different target library subsets
                              constraining     all     paths.      mv_special:
       the net associated with the hier pin is power switch control, isolation
       control or
                              retention control.

       CTS-903  (Warning)  Cells  instantiated in the clock network are not in
       the clock reference list

DESCRIPTION
       CTS can only size to lib_cells that are specified in the  clock  refer-
       ence   list,   constrained  using  &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose  -include  cts
       $lib_cell_list&#x27;.  This message indicates that some  cells  instantiated
       in the clock network have reference lib_cells that are not in the clock
       reference list.  If there are logically  equivalent  lib_cells  in  the
       reference list, then these instances can still be resized to those log-
       ically equivalent lib_cells, if necessary.  There is no guarantee  that
       the  cell  will be resized, and once resized it cannot be sized back to
       the original lib_cell that was not in the reference list.

       If there are no logically equivalent cells in the reference list,  then
       this  cell  will not be resized by CTS, and a CTS-904 message will also
       be issued by check_clock_trees, indicating that no logically equivalent
       cells are available.

WHAT NEXT
       No  action  is  necessary  if the behavior described above is okay.  If
       resizing of the cell  is  desired,  ensure  that  logically  equivalent
       lib_cells  are  available  using the &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts
       $lib_cell_list&#x27; command.  Note that there is no guarantee that the cell
       will  be  resized,  and  so it may remain in the clock network with its
       original reference cell which was not supplied in the  clock  reference
       list.  If you want to guarantee that this reference cell does not exist
       in the clock network after CTS completes, then you must manually  asso-
       ciate it to a new lib_cell using the change_link command before running
       CTS.

<tr><td>CTS-904</td><td>Warning</td><td>NAME
       CTS-904 (Warning) Some clock reference cells have no LEQ cell specified
       for resizing

DESCRIPTION
       CTS cannot resize a cell in the clock network unless  there  are  logi-
       cally equivalent lib_cells specified in the clock reference list.  This
       message indicates that there are cells instantiated in the  clock  net-
       work that have no logically equivalent lib_cells in the reference list,
       so no sizing can be done.

WHAT NEXT
       If the cell does not need to be sized, or has optimization  constraints
       like dont_touch that prevent sizing, then no action is necessary.  Oth-
       erwise, use &#x27;set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts  $lib_cell_list&#x27;,  where
       $lib_cell_list  includes  logically  equivalent  lib_cells  to the ones
       reported by this check.  This will ensure that the cell can be  resized
       during CTS.

       ZRT-027 (warn) Ignore %d top cell ports with no pins.

DESCRIPTION
       This  warning  message indicates that the design&#x27;s top cell has logical
       ports which have no physical shapes attached to them.  The router  will
       ignore such ports.

WHAT NEXT
       Please check the top cell and create physical shapes for those ports if
       needed.</td><td>[fill severity]</td><td>Warning: Ignore 2 top cell ports with no pins. (ZRT-027) (MSG-3032)</td><td>[fill solution]</td></tr>

DESCRIPTION
       Via  regions  are  useful  in  avoiding  DRCs  in accessing pins and in
       accessing pins off the routing grid. It is defined  with  the  matching
       via specified by the contact code number.

WHAT NEXT
       Please  check  for  DRCs  in  accessing this pin, and check ZRT-038 for
       error in contact code number, and generate the via  regions  if  neces-
       sary.</td><td>[fill severity]</td><td>Warning: Standard cell pin LSUPX4_HVT/VDDL has no valid via regions. (ZRT-044) (MSG-3032)</td><td>[fill solution]</td></tr>

       ZRT-311  (warning)  Skipping antenna analysis for net %s. The pin %s on
       cell %s does not have enough gate area information.

DESCRIPTION
       One or more input pins of this net do not have the  correct  gate  area
       values.  So antenna analysis will not be done for this net.

       Limit for number of ZRT-311 messages is set to 100 by default for read-
       ability of the log file. In order to print more or all the ZRT-311 mes-
       sages,  set  this  message  limit to a very large number using set_mes-
       sage_info command.

WHAT NEXT
       Check and set correct gate area for all the input pins of  the  net  on
       all the metal &amp; cut layers.
        If gate area of some pins is not available, consider using app options
       route.detail.default_gate_size   and   route.detail.default_port_exter-
       nal_gate_size.  Value set for these options will be used for pins with-
       out gate area information during antenna analysis.

       If the gate area is unspecified but the diffusion area is specified for
       some  pins, and you want to use the diffusion area for antenna analysis
       for   such   pins,    then    set    app    option    route.detail.ana-
       lyze_antenna_for_pins_with_diffusion_area to true.</td><td>[fill severity]</td><td>Warning: Skipping antenna analysis for net clock_opt_cts_ZCTSNET_694. The pin CE2 on cell SRAM2RW16x4 does not have enough gate area information. (ZRT-311) (MSG-3032)</td><td>[fill solution]</td></tr>
