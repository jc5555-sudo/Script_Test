       Advanced reciever model  has  not  been  enabled  for  detailed  routed
       design.   For  improving accuracy of delay calculation and to correlate

       TIM-207  (Warning)  Libraries  do not have CCS noise model for accurate
       waveform analysis in advanced waveform propagation mode.

DESCRIPTION
       When advanced waveform propagation analysis is enabled, it is  required
       that  the  stage driver cell has CCS noise model(s) for its timing arcs
       in  terms of  either  arc-based  or   pin-based   CCS  noise  model(s).
       When  such CCS noise model(s) are not present in the library,  analysis
       with  desired accuracy cannot be performed.

WHAT NEXT
       Fix the library to ensure that all library cell timing arcs have either
       arc-based or pin-based CCS noise models.

       UPF-236  (warning)  Crosstool  app  option  is set to true, UPF may not
       match Verilog or SPEF.

DESCRIPTION
       This    Warning    message    occurs    when     the     app     option
       mv.upf.write_crosstool_wrappers   is   set  to  true.  The  app  option
       mv.upf.write_crosstool_wrappers is needed for exporting UPF  for  tools
       that do not support the use of  power domain on instance (PDOI) in UPF.
       With the app option set to true, instances that are  PDOI  are  grouped
       under  derived  hierarchical  modules  to resolved compatibility issues
       with other tools. The derived hierarchies are only added  during  ASCII
       output and are not represented in the block. The ASCII outputs that are
       affected are Verilog and SPEC from write_verilog  and  write_parasitics
       commands.  The  app  option does not impact the output of save_upf com-
       mand. That means logical mismatches can  exist  between  the  UPF  from
       save_upf command and SPEF or Verilog netlist.

       To  write a compatible UPF that includes the hierarchical wrappers, use
       the write_verilog  command.  When  the  app  option  is  set  to  true,
       write_verilog  will write a Verilog netlist and a compatible UPF at the
       same time.  The UPF will have the same name as the  Verilog  file  with
       the added extension &quot;.SNPS.upf&quot;.

WHAT NEXT
       If   you   have  a  multi-voltage  design  and  are  allowing  physical
       feedthrough buffers (opt.common.allow_physical_feedthroughset is  true)
       to  be  added during optimization and CTS, then you should use the com-
       patible UPF created by the write_verilog command for  ASCII  import  to
       other tools.

       If  you  are not allowing any physical feedthrough buffers during opti-
       mization and CTS, you can ignore this warning or  set  the  app  option
